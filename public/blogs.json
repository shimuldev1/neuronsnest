If your site takes longer to load than it does to microwave popcorn, or if it looks like a spreadsheet threw up on the screen… poof. They’re gone. But a sharp, modern site? That’s like rolling out the red carpet. It says, “We’ve got our act together,” before you’ve even said a word. And guess what? People stick around for businesses that look legit."
